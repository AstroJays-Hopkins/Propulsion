Max Hahn takes data from data log and converts to US units of measurement where needed (Temp)\
Saves as excel \'97> Excel imported by Dan Zanko to Matlab\
	\'93HF1_RawConverted.mat\'94 \'97 .mat created of this \'93raw data\'94\
	\'93HF1_fulltest.mat\'94\'97A new set was created with a start at 722 (raw.mat - when fueling starts) until 3397(index from raw.mat - when ox mass returns to constant (end of propellant flow)) (time zeroed)\
	\'93HF1_nomburn.mat\'94\'97A new set was created started at 3116 (MV-R1 starts opening) to 3227 (when large drop-off in thrust observed)\

\f2\i\b0 \ulnone Propellant Loading:\
	
\f1\i0 ~0.8lbm rise starting at index722 and ending at ~index799\
	Mass is help steady then until ~index1207 when it then begins to steadily rise with a trace similar to an inverted parabola\
	Loading rate slows at ~2627\
	Ox mass levels out at ~2724 and holds there until engine is fired.

\

\f2\i\b0 \ulnone Engine startup:
\f1\i0 \
	MV-R1 starts opening at index 3116 (first TRUE value in raw data .mat) - last true value at 3121\
\

\f2\i Attempted shutdown
\f1\i0 \
	MV-R1 attempts close at index 3164 (first TRUE value in raw data .mat) - last true value at 3165\
\

\f2\i Actual \'93shutdown\'94\

\f1\i0 	Total Thrust (LC-C1 + LC-C2) drops off significantly at index 3227 (in raw data .mat)\
	LC-R1 (ox tank) levels out at index 3371 \
	PT-C1 (chamb press) levels out at index 3345}
